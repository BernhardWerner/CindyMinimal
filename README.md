# CindyMinimal
A minimal template for a locally running [CindyJS](https://github.com/CindyJS) project.

If you download this, you're good to go with a plain HTML file that runs a minimal init- and draw-script. The Cindy object create a single geometric point upon instatiation and loads a simple image to draw.
