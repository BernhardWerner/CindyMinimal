# CindyMinimal
A minimal template for a locally running [CindyJS](https://github.com/CindyJS) project.

If you download this, you're good to go with a plain HTML file that runs a minimal init- and draw-script. The Cindy object create a single geometric point upon instatiation and loads a simple image to draw.

Note that this doesn't inlcude any plugins. In particular, the KaTeX plugin will immediately be loaded from the official CindyJs servers as soon as you try to render text that contains TeX code.
