A minimal template for a locally running [CindyJS](https://github.com/CindyJS) widget.

If you download this, you're good to go with a plain HTML file that runs a minimal init- and draw-script. The Cindy object create a single geometric point upon instatiation and loads a simple image to draw.

Note that this doesn't inlcude any plugins except for KaTeX. CindyGL, Cindy3D, etc. have to be downloaded or loaded from the official CindyJS servers.
